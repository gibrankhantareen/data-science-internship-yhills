# Vaccination Prediction - Capstone Project 

In recent times, vaccination has emerged as one of the most effective measures to control the spread of infectious diseases, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted its significance. With the availability of multiple vaccines, it has become essential to devise strategies to ensure their effective distribution and administration. This is where data science can play a crucial role. By leveraging data analytics and predictive modelling techniques, we can anticipate the demand for vaccines and optimize their allocation to achieve maximum coverage. 

In this project, we aim to develop a data-driven approach to predict whether a person got the H1N1 vaccine or not using demographic and health-related information from a survey. The project uses simple linear regression algorithm to build a model that predicts the target variable, which is whether the person got the vaccine or not. The input variables for the model include age, sex, race, education level, household income, employment status, chronic health conditions, perceived risk of getting the H1N1 flu, and whether the person received seasonal flu vaccine in the past. The model's accuracy can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, and the project's results can provide insights to public health officials to improve vaccination coverage in the population.
