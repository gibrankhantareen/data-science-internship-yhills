# Taxi Fare Prediction - Capstone Project 

Transportation has become an integral part of modern-day life, and taxis are a convenient mode of travel for many people. However, one of the primary concerns of taxi riders is the fare, which can vary depending on several factors such as distance, time, and demand. In this project, we aim to develop a data-driven approach to predict taxi fares accurately. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and historical trip data, we can create a model that takes into account various factors such as pickup and drop-off locations, travel distance, time of day, and weather conditions, among others. Our goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate the fare for a taxi ride with high accuracy, thereby benefiting both riders and taxi service providers. 

This project has significant implications for the transportation industry, as it can help taxi companies optimize their pricing strategies and provide a better user experience for passengers.

This project aims to predict the fare of a taxi ride in New York City, given the pickup and dropoff locations.

Results: The model achieved a root mean squared error (RMSE) of $4.32 on the validation set, indicating predictive accuracy of 33%. However, further improvements could be made by incorporating additional features such as time of day, weather conditions, and traffic congestion.
